# YOLOv5 Fine-Tuning Notebook

Welcome! This repo is all about fine-tuning the YOLOv5 model for object detection. I’m diving into YOLO architecture and experimenting with it on custom datasets.

## What’s Inside

- **Dataset**: Instructions to get your dataset from Roboflow.
- **Training**: How to fine-tune YOLOv5 with your data.
- **Inference**: Testing the model on ImageNet images and also a custom dataset you can either create yourself on Roboflow or work on a ready one from their.
- **Export**: Saving and exporting the fine-tuned model.
